# **Hafeef<em>AI</em> Chatbot App**

## 📚 **Overview**

The **HafeefaI Chatbot App** is a web application built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **FastAPI**. It is designed to interact with users through an **AI-powered chatbot**, providing engaging and informative responses.
The frontend is powered by **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, while the backend uses **FastAPI** to handle API calls and data processing.

## 💡 **Inspiration**

I have always been fascinated by **AI agents** and wanted to explore how they work, which inspired me to create this **chatbot app**. 
It was an incredible learning experience to understand what's involved in building an **AI-driven application**, especially when integrating technologies like **Anthropic's API**. 
I also wanted to deepen my **backend development** skills and ended up learning a lot about **Python** and **FastAPI** throughout this project.
